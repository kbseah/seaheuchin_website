<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The text is transcribed from photographs of the tomb engraving of Seah Eu Chin, located on Grave Hill in Toa Payoh. The inscription contains honorary official titles awarded by the Qing imperial government. Seah Eu Chin's widow died in 1905. This inscription must therefore be from that year or later, although the language used indicates that the honorary titles were conferred while she was still alive (see below). </p>

<ul>
<li>考 - Deceased father
<li>妣 - Deceased mother
<li>中憲大夫 - Grand Master Exemplar, honorary title of the 4th grade granted to civil officials (Hucker 1560)
<li>恭人 - Respected Person, honorary title of the 4th grade for women
<li>誥授 - Award of title by patent (誥)
<li>誥贈/誥封 - 封 is the grant of a title, and 贈 is the term used for a posthumously granted honour; 誥 refers to imperial patent that confers such honours. From this, and the typographical layout of the inscription (read vertically from right to left), we can infer that 陳明月 was the first wife of Seah Eu Chin, and 陳明珠 was her younger sister, who was still alive when she was granted the title of 恭人.
</ul>

<ul class="zh">
<li>考 - 去世的父亲
<li>妣 - 去世的母亲
<li>誥授、誥贈、誥封 - 朝廷用诰命封爵位
<li>中憲大夫 - 
<li>恭人 - 四品命婦的封号
</ul>

<p>"Hucker" refers to numbered entry in Charles O Hucker, <i>A dictionary of official titles in Imperial China</i> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1985).
