<p>R. Church Esquire</p>
<p>Secretary to the Governor of the Straits Settlements</p>

<p>Sir</p>
<p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of yesterday’s date conveying the assurance of the satisfaction felt by his honor the Governor in granting me a certificate of naturalization under Act XXX of 1852.</p>
<p>In reply I beg you will be pleased to inform his honor that the gratification I experienced in attaining my certificate of naturalization as a British Subject is much enhanced by the handsome manner in which his honor has been pleased to grant the same, and that it is the certainty, the impartiality and the justice of the British Law and the mildness the freedom and the equitableness of British rule, experienced during a residence of 29 Years in Singapore, which has induced me to avail of the benefits which the said Act XXX of 1852 confers. </p>
<p>I have the honor to be, Sir</p>
<p>Your most obedient Servant</p>
